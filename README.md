# NetworkZ

NetworkZ is a library of graph algorithms in Python. It is an extension of the [NetworkX](https://github.com/networkx/networkx). It contains (by import) everything that is in NetworkX, plus some additional algorithms that were submitted into NetworkX but not merged yet. Currently, NetworkZ contains the following additional algorithms:

* [Rank-maximal matching](networkz/algorithms/bipartite/rank_maximal_matching.py): by Oriya Alperin, Liel Vaknin and Amiel Lejzor.
* [Social-aware coalition formation](networkz/algorithms/approximation/coalition_formation.py) - by Victor Kushnir.

## Installation

```
pip install networkz
```

This installs the latest version of networkx, and the new algorithms added in networkz.
